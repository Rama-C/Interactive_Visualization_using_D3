# Interactive_Visualization_using_D3
Flight data visualization uses the data of domestic flights operated from all US states for the years 2004 through 2016. Each state is represented by its capital in the US map. The number of flights operated from each state is animated for the years 2004 through 2016. Different colours and sizes are used on the map to represented the flight counts.
 
Analysis of the Flight data reveals that 
- The number of flights operated per year gradually decreases after the year 2007 except the year 2013. 
- The states like Texas, California, Florida and Newyork always maintained high flight operating counts
- The states like Montana, Idaho, North Dakota and South Dakota always had low fight operating counts.


The index_one.html had an animation with just single coloured representations on the map. The variation in flight counts are presented by its size.

Feedbacks: 

Siva:   I could see the some circles changes its radius every year but I couldn’t get much information from this. 
Monica: Animation seems to be fast ,thus preventing us from grasping the information.
Anu:    Various size of the circles represents the variation but couldn’t get how big is the variation.


The index_two.html had an animation with three different colours and a legend was included to interpret the colours.

Feedbacks:

Siva:   The different colours on the map, along with the legend is helping me to get some information.I can differentiate the states which always had high/low flight counts over the years. 
Monica: Eventhough the speed of the animation remains the same, I can see the changes from one category to another category clearly. Also felt that the circle representations for the legend was too big especially the green one.
Anu:    The map of 2004 has more green coloured circles. During the animation, I could see that many circles changed its colour and the map of 2016 has more orange and red circles than 2004.

The index_final.html illustrates the interactive version of the map. This includes a slider to select a year, a Playbutton is used to play the animation and Stopbutton is used to stop the animation.

Feedbacks:

Siva:   The slider helps me to see the data for an year.Also it helps me to start the animation from the year of my choice and stop it in between.
Monica: I can take my own time to get the information. The changes in the map can be compared easily.
Anu:    The interactive things on the visualisation helps me to see the change and  to find out  variations in every year. I can focus on all the circles now.
